#Where the MadMoney Goes
==========

Project developed for the Innova Challenge Big Data launched by the BBVA Innovation Center 
    
Built to analyze the *consumer geographical behaviour* and discover the relationship between buying outside/inside the neighbourhood and the presence of chain stores (such us Zara, El Corte Ingl√©s, Ikea...)
The idea behind the project is to *promote the proximity shopping* by helping entrepreneurs to make decisions about which kind of commerce could make sense in the areas they are thinking to set up a business.
Both, data analysis and visualization were developed in R.
